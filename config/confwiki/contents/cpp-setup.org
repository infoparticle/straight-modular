* My Summary

- cscope + emacs is done deal. Adding gnu global is also fine.
- To get intellisense we need higher cmake/clangd/cquery/ccls than centos 7 servers.
- Simply switch to visual studio and get it done - for old servers!
- for the latest Fedora 29, we can try these new things, perhaps rsync back to old servers!
- lsp + ccls is the way to go (not CDETS not Semenantic mode etc.)
